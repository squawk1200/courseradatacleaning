This section describes the variables in the tidy data set.

Subject: This a number from 1 - 30 identifying the subject for whom the measurements apply.

ActivityName: This a character data type describing the activity that the subject was performing when measurements were taken.


Accelerometer Measurements (Mean and Standard Deviation): The remaining variables are the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements for the subject performing a specific activity.

**Study Design**

Data for this study was provided by:

[1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012


** Transformations **

1. The training and test measurement data were merged.
2. A descriptive name for each activity was added.
3. The subject identifier was added for each measurement.
4. A descriptive name for each column was added
5. Only measurement with "-mean" or "-std" in their column names were kept - all other measurements were discarded.
6. The data set was aggregated by subject and activity name and averaged for each measurement.
